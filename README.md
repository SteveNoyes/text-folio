A text based game that will serve as a folio.

Begins in room, key on floor.

Key opens door to office. 

In office is desk with resume, a diary (about section) in the drawer and an open terminal.

The terminal is access to my projects (url to live project or github) and emailing me.

Sit at the terminal and type in the password (command) you find in the diary and it will open up my special project or something like that.
